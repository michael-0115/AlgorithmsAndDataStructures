#### 000_Python_Programming
* 001_Getting Started with Python Data Types and Built-in Methods
* 002_Building User-Defined Python Classes and Methods
* 003_File Manipulation and Basic Data Analysis without using Python build-in methods

#### 001A_Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Task1-5: 
* 1. Use the ADT class for points in pairwise Manhattan distance
* 2. To find the closest pair of points 
    * Implement the naiveO(n2)brute-force algorithm
    * Implement the divide-and-conquer algorithm.
* 3. Perform an empirical runtime evaluation for both algorithms
Task6
* 4. Data visualisation using Bokeh

#### 001B_Single-link clustering with Kruskalâ€™s algorithm
* 1. Start by assigning each data point (representing location of customers) its own partition and successively join clusters of data points or customer nodes until we end up with a single big cluster.
* 2. Data visualisation using Bokeh
